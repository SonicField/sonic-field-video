Video processing scripts and tools (my play area really)

What is this?
=============

A play area for contiually updating and improving video processing scripts based on ffmpeg.  Maybe in the future ther stuff will be added.

What this is not?
=================

A formal project with structure and direction.

OK Suggetions
=============

* This is cool.
* You screwed up the color space in that script no wonder it looks pants.

Not OK Suggestions
==================

* You need to make this into a formal program.
* zsh sucks - use 'insert shell script here'.
* Why not do this in Python?

Why this is not in Python
-------------------------

That is a good question... I live in an environment with tens of millions of lines of Python for my day job; I don't want to take work home with me!


Where do I get ffmpeg
=====================

I get it from here: https://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/

I make ZERO guarantees about the validity or security of the files from there!

ffmpeg is awesome btw.

**Enjoy**
