# Description:
# Grades a clip using luminosity value and gamma, color gamma and colour levels.
# However, the color levels only impact where the particular color channel is active in the
# CR,CB and (synthetic) CG space.  I.E a change in the R value will have no effect if the CR
# channel is negative (i.e. a shade of green) for example.
#
# The result is passed through a gamut limiter lut to stop excessive excursion of the the color channels. 
#
# Args:
# <video in> <brighten amount> <luma gamma amount> <chroma gamma amount> <green> <blue> <red>

# Examples

# Direct flog countryside  1.02 | 1.2 | 1.1 | 1.1 | 0.8 | 1.1     Takes out down the sky a bit - looks nice after soften
# Control over saturated   1.0  | 1.0 | 0.9 | 1   | 1   | 1       If the near highlights are very saturated this helps
# Final 'flowers' setting  1.1  | 2   | 1   | 1.2 | 1   | 0.7     Bending luma gama viaully controlled over saturation.
# Me talking!              1.1  | 1.2 | 1   | 1   | 1   | 0.9     Bit more contrast if the input is bright, less red.
# Beacons Bright Light     1.0  | 0.8 | 1.2 | 1   |0.8  | 1.5     Takes down the sky and makes countryside warm.
#
# parameters in detail:
# =====================
#
# brighten amount
# ---------------
# linear multplier of luma after applying gamma curve.
# this should used to get peak to the legal limit.
#
# luma gmama amount
# -----------------
# raise the scaled luma to this power.
# this is a simple power gamma.
# > 1 more constrast looking, crushed dark.
# < 1 brighter, crushed highlights.
#
# chroma gamma amount
# -------------------
# inverse of power on chroma.  the higher the number the more saturated low saturation
# areas will look.  as colors approach pure white the effect deminishes. gama is 1/this
# which makes it visually similar to the gama for luma; i.e. larger number = more staturates.
#
# Green
# -----
# Scale the green component of color. Only impacts where a color is green positive.
#
# Blue
# ----
# Scale the blue component of color. Only impacts where a color is blue positive.
#
# Red
# ---
# Scale the red component of color. Only impacts where a color is red positive.
#
# Notes:
# ======
#
# It will lock overbright to 100% luma - check the waveform!
# The saturation is a power effect not a direct effect; 2 takes the root so staturates a lot.
# 1.3 is vivid. 2 is rediculous.
# blue is the blue multiplier = to remove too much blue (e.g. water/sky) < 1.
# red/green is the red/green multiplier = to remove too much red/green  < 1.
