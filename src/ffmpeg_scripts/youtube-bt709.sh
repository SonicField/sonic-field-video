# Description:
# Produce youtube output converted to bt709 from linear light.
# The output is in yuv42010le which seems a good compromise to send to
# youtube as I have no evidence youtube uses better then yuv420p.
#
# Compressions is x265 which gives the smallest file size for the best
# quality.  Moving crf down from 30 might make a difference but this seems
# about right in terms of internet upload speed compared to the compression
# youtube will then add.
#
# Fiddle with 'threads' for more cores, on my Mac Book Pro i9 8 is optimal;
# any more just heats up the CPU for no benefit as x265 takes most of the
# power anyhow.
#
# Args:
# <video in>
#
# Out:
# <*-youtube-bt709.mkv
