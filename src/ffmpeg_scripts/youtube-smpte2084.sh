# Description:
# Produce youtube output
#
# Args:
# <video in>
#
# Out:
# <*-youtube-x265.mp4
#
# Notes to explane mappings.
# ==========================
# 
# The input to this converter is in linear light however its output needs to be
# in smpte2084/bt2020 for youtube to encode HDR.
# Even though the encoding pipeline is metadata marked as smpt 2084
# ffmpeg does not appear to be actually changing the color. Anyhow, this can be
# worked around by telling zscale to treat the import as linear and the output as
# smpte2084/bt2020. Then feed that into another zscale to upscale. The second one believes the
# first and passed through smpte 2084 and we are golden.
#
# Was that easy to figure out - no.
#
# Note that smtpe/bt2020 uses a strange hybride gamma and color system - trying to figure this
# out manually is sort of possible gamma wise but then red and blue are too dark. Be warned.
#
# Also - doing the conversions in yuv444p12le means the interpolation does not cause banding and we
# cleanly then drop down to yuv444p10le on output so the mapping does not cause any noticable
# degridation.
#
# The issue here is that at the time I was doing all this, HDR on youtube seems broken and all
# the input gets brightness squashed so peek white becomes 90% white. All in all I just gave
# up and went over to bt709.
